        Red Rising is a dystopian sci-fi novel by <u>Pierce Brown</u> about a 16-year-old named <u>Darrow</u> who lives in a
        color-coded society on Mars in the distant future
        The story takes place in a solar system where humans have colonized planets and created color-based social
        castes. The <i><b>Golds</b></i> are at the top of the social hierarchy, while the Reds are the lowest caste.
        <u>Darrow</u> is a Red who works as a miner on Mars, extracting <i><b>helium-3</b></i> to terraform the planet. Darrow believes he is
        working toward a better future for humanity, but discovers that Mars has been inhabited for generations by the
        Golds, who exploit the Reds as slave labor.
        <u>Darrow</u> is rescued by a group of rebels who disguise him as a Gold and infiltrate the Golds' command school.
        Darrow's goal is to take down his oppressors from within.
        Some say the book's premise is similar to <b>The Hunger Games or Battle Royale</b>. Others say the book is intense,
        brutal, and addictive.
        A board game based on the book is available. <u>Pierce Brown</u> is also working with screenwriters to adapt Red Rising
        into a movie
